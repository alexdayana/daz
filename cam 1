This means that if you have experience with cameras and their settings in the real world, you already know a lot about them in a virtual setting too. But they are still quite different. Mainly because software cameras don’t need to obey any real-world laws and physics. "

Consequently, here you can both move and rotate your camera along any of the three main axis. Probably the most flexible and convenient way is to change your viewport to the camera view. You need to find the dropdown menu at the top right corner of a viewport. Now choose your Camera in this menu Your view will be transported to that of a camera. And now you can use any default means of moving the viewport. Such as Orbiting, Panning and Zooming. After you place the camera where you want it, just change in the same drop-down menu to the Perspective view or any other. Now you have a camera directed at anything you want. "
